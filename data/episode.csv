Davenport, Honey Davenport, Plastique Tiara, Ra'Jah, Scarlet Envy, and Shuga Cain) are critiqued for severely lackluster performances and a general lack of knowledge about Mariah Carey, though most of their runways are well-received. When every member of Team Ra'Jah claims that they were all to blame for the failing challenge, Ru puts every team member up for elimination in a series-first six-way lip sync, having them lip-sync to ""Waiting for Tonight (Hex Hector Mix)"" by Jennifer Lopez.

Immediately after the mini challenge, RuPaul brings back to the workroom six queens that were eliminated earlier in the competition -- Shuga Cain, Plastique Tiara, Scarlet Envy, Ariel Versace, Honey Davenport, and Soju. RuPaul then describes the main challenge, where each of the remaining queens has to use her own drag aesthetic to makeover one of the eliminated queens as a member of her drag house. The eliminated queens have to wear large pink gloves during the makeover so they are prevented from doing their own makeup. RuPaul also explains that the eliminated queens would not be returning to the competition and that they are only present for this challenge. Since Brooke Lynn won the mini challenge, she wins the right to pair the remaining and eliminated queens. She chooses Plastique for herself, then pairs Shuga with Nina West, Honey with A'Keria C. Davenport, Scarlet with Yvie Oddly, Soju with Silky Nutmeg Ganache (much to the latter's dismay), and Ariel with Vanessa Vanjie Mateo.
On the main stage, A'Keria C.

Seven of the queens say Silky should go home, while the other five say Yvie should.

"F10S12E04","F10S12","F10","4","""The Ball Ball""",2020-03-20,"For the mini-challenge, the queens get into quick drag dressed up as bees and shake their stingers in a beehive jive dance-off to raise awareness about the decreasing global bee population. Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this week's maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of Kim Chi and Trixie Mattel, originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.
On the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a ""home run"" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to ""S&M"" by Rihanna. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.
The next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a Grey's Anatomy parody titled ""Gay's Anatomy"".

The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. Carson Kressley directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction.

Some of the queens, notably Brita, say how proud they are of how Aiden did in the competition, with Widow Von'Du claiming they were being fake after the criticism Aiden had previously received at various times. The queens rehash some of the critical comments made during the previous week's Untucked episode, with notable conflict between Gigi Goode and Heidi N Closet and well as between Jackie Cox and Widow.
At the start of the next day, the tension remains. RuPaul enters the workroom and tells the queens that the week’s maxi-challenge is called ""Madonna: The Unauthorized Rusical"". For the challenge, the queens will have to sing lyrics and learn choreography for a musical chronicling Madonna's life and career.
